# mollusca_illustrations
This is code to access BHL API to get mollusca illustrations
You will need an API key to access the Biodiversity Heritage Library API for this code to work. That can be done through here: http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/getapikey.aspx
You will also need to create a file on your computer called "images" to store all of the illustrations that need to be downloaded. 
Thanks!
